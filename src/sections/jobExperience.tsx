                            Led the entire technical lifecycle, from concept to launch, while overseeing a dynamic team
                            of 5 engineers. Actively designed, coordinated and contributed to the code base, evolving it
                            from functional prototype into a robust, scalable production application.

                            Assumed the pivotal role of sole people manager for the technical team, including
                            establishing a comprehensive performance management process, upleveling the engineering
                            team. Additionally, was responsible for all engineering hiring, from managing external
                            recruiting agencies, designing an interview process custom to Chadâ€™s needs, and bringing in
                            the individuals to the team.

                            Led a team of 6 engineers responsible for processing business-critical bank reporting
                            (SWIFT/BAI), pivotal to Stripe's accounting reconciliation and bank transfer products.
                            Managed seamless communication and collaboration across stakeholders, including internal
                            teams (Accounting, Treasury, Banking Operations) and external banking partners.

                        <PrettyLI>
                            Orchestrated the architectural overhaul and migration of report processing, shifting from a
                            legacy, single-threaded pipeline to a distributed event driven system. This transformation
                            substantially enhanced service reliability and reduced processing time by hours. As a
                            result, Stripe efficiently met escalating regulatory demands and expanded support for new
                            product categories and geographies.
