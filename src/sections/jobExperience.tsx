                            As a senior member of the team, I am currently
                            leading an effort to safely migrate report
                            processing from a legacy processing pipeline to a
                            distributed, SOA pipeline.

                            As a result, we have begun to safely migrate several
                            reports, increasing SLA compliance, reducing
                            processing time by hours, enabling Stripe to meet
                            it's increasing regulatory burden.
